It's funny how the aroma of certain foods can act as a time machine, instantly transporting you back to cherished moments. As I stand here in my Dublin kitchen, the scent of baking ricotta mingling with the crisp December air, I'm not just in Ireland anymore. I'm also back in São Paulo, in my mother's cozy kitchen, watching her work her culinary magic. This Christmas, that magic comes in the form of a Ricotta Pie – a dish that, while Italian, resonates deeply with my Brazilian heart.

### The Heart of the Recipe

This isn't just any pie. This is a tribute. A delicious, cheesy tribute to my mother. Every Christmas, she'd make her "Torta de Queijo," a savory, creamy masterpiece. This ricotta pie, while a touch different, captures that same essence of warmth and love.

> [!IDEA]
> Food connects us to our roots, no matter how far we roam. This ricotta pie is my way of bringing a piece of my mother's kitchen, and a slice of my Brazilian heritage, to my Christmas table in Dublin.

### Breaking Down the Ingredients

Now, my mom's recipe was a bit... let's call it "intuitive." A pinch of this, a handful of that. It was all about feeling, not measuring. While I respect that, I prefer having a bit more structure. So I've taken some liberties, documented every step, and measured every ingredient.

Here's what we need, inspired by the Italian tradition, but with a nod to my own preferences:

| Ingredient        | Standard Measurement | Grams |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ----- |
| Puff Pastry       | 250 g                | 250g  |
| Ricotta Cheese    | 500 g                | 500g  |
| Eggs              | 3 large              | 171g  |
| Mozzarella Cheese | 125 g                | 125g  |
| Parmesan Cheese   | 100 g                | 100g  |
| Dried Parsley     | 2 tsp                | 2g    |
| Salt              | 0.5 tsp              | 3g    |
| Black Pepper      | To taste             | -     |
| Egg White         | 1                    | 33g   |

### Crafting the Pie: A Step-by-Step Journey

**1. The Pastry Foundation:**

First, we take our puff pastry and lay it gently into the mold. No need to rush; let it settle in. Any extra, just trim it off. Then, into the fridge it goes. We want it chilled and relaxed, just like a calm Sunday morning in St. Patrick's Cathedral Park.

**2. The Cheesy Heartbeat:**

In a bowl, we combine the ricotta and those three eggs (about 171g, if you're keeping track).
> [!TIP]
> Use a mixer to get a smooth, homogeneous mixture. Think of it like blending sounds to create a beautiful piece of music – each ingredient playing its part.

Next, in go the mozzarella cubes, grated Parmesan, a sprinkle of dried parsley (roughly 2g), a dash of salt (about 3g), and a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper.

**3. Uniting the Flavors:**

Now, remember that chilled pastry? It's time. Brush it with a bit of egg white (around 33g). Then, pour in our glorious cheese mixture, spreading it evenly.

> [!BRAIN] Why to use egg shites in the pastry?
> **Structure and Lift**: Egg whites are mostly protein and water. When you brush them on puff pastry, the proteins coagulate with the heat, helping the layers separate and puff up nicely. This creates that light, airy texture we all love.
> **Sealing**: Egg whites can help seal the edges of your pastry, preventing fillings from leaking out and keeping everything neat and tidy.


**4. Into the Oven:**

We bake this beauty at 180°C (or 356°F for my American friends) for about 45 minutes. Keep an eye on it – we're aiming for a golden-brown crust, the color of a perfect sunset over the River Liffey.

**5. Patience, Patience:**

Once it's out, let it cool. I know, it's tempting to dive right in, but trust me, it's worth the wait. It's like waiting for the perfect pão de queijo – the anticipation only makes it better. Especially when we compare with the ones from Dolce Sicily.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> Imagine biting into a slice of this pie: the crispy pastry, the creamy ricotta, the sharpness of the Parmesan, the subtle hint of parsley. It's a symphony of flavors, a taste of home, a hug from my mom, all in one bite.

### More Than Just a Recipe

This ricotta pie isn't just about food. It's about connection. It's about remembering where I come from, even as I build my life here in Dublin. It's about sharing a piece of my heart with the people I love, like Rachel, who's become such an important part of my life here. We went to Rome, Florence, and Venice last year, and since then, I've been trying a lot of Italian recipes. But this one, it's just, perfect.

So, this Christmas, as you gather around your table, I invite you to try this recipe. Maybe it will spark a memory for you, too. Maybe it will become a new tradition. Or maybe, it will simply be a delicious way to spend an afternoon. Whatever it is, I hope it brings you as much joy as it brings me.

Merry Christmas, everyone. May your days be filled with love, laughter, and, of course, delicious food.
