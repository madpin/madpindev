<!--- # Hello World! (Or should I say "Olá Mundo"?) -->


Hey everyone, I'm Thiago, a Software Engineer at Indeed, calling Dublin, Ireland home these days.
But my story begins in the bustling city of São Paulo, Brazil.  
From a young age, I've been captivated by the power of technology, a passion further fueled by my family's entrepreneurial spirit.  
After earning my degree in Automation and Control Engineering, I knew I was destined for a life intertwined with code.


## A Decade of Code and Counting

My career has been anything but linear – and I wouldn't have it any other way!
It all started over a decade ago, diving into the worlds of C#, PHP, and mobile development back in Brazil.  Over the years, I've transitioned through various roles, from Business Intelligence Analyst to Data Engineer, and now to my current position as a Staff Software Engineer.  This journey has allowed me to hone my skills in data intelligence and problem-solving, becoming a specialist in finding elegant solutions to complex challenges.  Whether it's wrangling massive datasets with Python and Pandas, crafting intricate ETL pipelines with Pentaho, or visualizing data insights with Microstrategy, I thrive on the challenge of transforming raw data into actionable knowledge.

## Dublin - A New Chapter

A pivotal moment in my journey was a transformative exchange program in Dublin.  The city's vibrant energy, friendly atmosphere, and thriving tech scene captivated me. It felt like home, and eventually, it became just that!  Now, Dublin serves as the backdrop for both my professional and personal adventures.


## Beyond the Code - Photography and Personal Growth

Outside the world of code, I pursue another passion: photography.  Wandering through Dublin's streets with my camera, I try to capture the city's unique character, its hidden gems, and the everyday moments that make it so special.  For me, photography is a form of creative expression, a way to connect with the world around me, and a welcome counterpoint to the analytical nature of my work.

I'm also a firm believer in the importance of work-life balance.  As someone navigating ADHD and anxiety, I know firsthand how crucial it is to prioritize both mental and physical well-being.  Regular walks, invigorating cycles through the Irish countryside, and quality time with friends and family help me recharge and stay focused.
